At the risk of sounding like a 1950s behaviorist, my main problem with all this talk 
is that it inappropriately personifies the language model. 
"Hallucinate" suggests that we are dealing with a conscious being, 
"fabricate" suggests that we are dealing with something that can act intentionally. 
Neither of these ideas is anything close to scientifically proven, so I think we should be reserved in using language that points that way. 


Of course, at a deep intuitive level. we cannot avoid personifying anything that behaves enough like a person. Yes, I could entertain 
philosophical arguments that we don't REALLY know enough about other people to be sure that they are conscious, intentional beings. 
It is just part of the (very successful) human primate way of being to attribute to others the same consciousness and agency that 
we believe our own selves to have.  Yes, in the future of AI we may need to extend the same courtesy to non-human agents. 
But let's not rush in that direction.
