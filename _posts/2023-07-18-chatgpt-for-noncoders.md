## Answer to a question amounting to "Will ChatGPT write everything for me. I don't know how to code

The hardest part of programming is not the code. The hard part is learning how to break a task down into organized, explicit logical steps that do the job you want. This takes time and effort for everyone. 
It's not a natural way of thinking. Then, once you think you have understood the problem, you convert it into code, run it, and ninety-nine times out of a hundred you find that your thinking was roughly OK, but you hadn't actually thought through all the details. So you make a change, run that, and after a few more cycles you have something that works.
The thinking and testing is what matters. Once you have that down with one programming language, it is relatively easy to do it in another programming language. Modern programming languages get in the way of the thinking less than some older ones. ChatGPT can certainly help you with the idea to code part, but you will still need to be able to understand how to run and test the code that it makes. because it won't be right first time. It's a helper, not a magic wizard.
