## Confidence tricks

Confidence tricksters work by getting us to trust them, then getting us to do things that benefit them, but which we would not otherwise do. Usually, the 
trick depends on creating an illusion. If you get an unexpected call that claims to be from your bank, there is a chance that you
actually speaking to someone else, and they are not really trying to help you. They may want to get your login details and use them to empty your account. 
That's why banks promise that they will never ask for your account numbers over the phone or in an email. Tricks like this go back to ancient times: all that 
the internet has done is made some of them easier to do and harder to detect. To be fair, the internet has probably made other scams harder: it is no longer 
as easy as it once was to turn up in some remote place and claim to be a medical doctor. Then again, on the internet nobody knows if you are a dog. Most people, most of 
the time, have meaningful interactions with people whom they have never met and never expect to meet. The possibilities for deception are endless, and some 
of them enable confidence tricks.

In a modern setting, the victim of a confidence trick (the mark) need not be an individual. It could be a company that is induced to take actions that are not necessarily in its interest. The dynamics are similar, because companies are made of people, and the corporate environment does not prevent them from falling for modernized versions of the con artists old tricks. 

## Chat GPT

Chat GPT is a so-called _generative ai_ system that has created a lot of excitement. It can produce written text that is a very good match, in terms of style, 
for what would be produced by an expert. You name the field, if there is written text about it, Chat GPT can produce text whose style closely resembles what an expert
might produce. Either Chat GPT is actually a superhumanly smart polymath or it is a counter-example to the common assumption that if you write like an expert you must be an
expert. I tend to believe the second alternative. That's partly because its performance on things that I know about is not reliably good. If I am right, 
we are certainly dealing with an illusion. Its creators, OpenAI, are straightforward in admitting that 
they do intend to replace the current research prototype with a paid-for service, and their revenue projections, if realized, will certainly make the 
company rich. Perhaps this is all above board. Or perhaps Open AI is fooling itself, or perhaps Open AI knows exactly what is doing and trying to fool us. 
If the third alternative is right, the whole thing is a confidence trick and we are the marks. Let's look at this more closely. 

## The stages of a confidence trick (from David Maurer)

The description that follows is from David Maurer, an academic writing in the 1950s. There are nine stages of a con. Imagine a gang of swindlers preying on 
people during and after a train journey from small towns to a bigger city. The picaresque language is dated, as is the setting, but the concepts haven't changed in 70 years.

## 1. Putting the mark up
 
The point of this is to find someone who it is worth swindling, but who maybe lacks the network and resources to avoid the con. A very rich mark would probably have access to lawyers and financial advisors, and between them they would smell a rat. At the end of this stage, one of the swindlers has met a
potential mark and begun to establish a friendly relationship.
 
## 2. Playing the con for him


When the mark gets off the train, one of the swindlers offers to show him around town (in this olde worlde setting the mark is male, for sure). There will be talk of business opprtunities, but this is just seting the stage. The point is to establish trust.

 
## 3. Roping the mark
 
In the next stage the mark is passed from the first swindler to a second one, who will take over. The point of this stage is to establish the second swindler as fabulously successful, and to make the mark want to work with him and share in the success.
 
## 4. Telling him the tale
 
At this stage, the mark isn't sure of the basis for the second swindlers success, but is curious and wants in on the secret. The mark may suggest collaboration, but at this stage the swindler does not take up the suggestion, and will typically let drop that his success might be a bit shady. 
This only enhances the mark's interest and prepares him for the swindler's eventual and apparently reluctant willingness to let him in on the scheme.
 
## 5. Giving him the convincer
 
Now the swindler *shows* the mark that the scheme works, by making a bit of money for him. Most likely, the con men never hand over the money that has
been made, but immediately offer to reinvest it. The mark still hasn't invested any of his own money, but feels like he has, and is deeply involved.
At this point it is helpful if the con men can also make the mark feel privileged to be part of their exciting big city world.

The context of the train ride and the big city is important, because the mark only has a short time to spend in the city. Unless he moves fast, he might miss the opportunity. 

In the modern context, there any number of ways in which a company playing the role of the mark can be induced to believe that decisions must be made fast, even if this would require the usual controls and sanity checks to be bypassed.
 
## 6. Giving him the breakdown
 
Now the swindlers set up the mark to add his own money to the scheme. They may do this in a group, with the others swindlers apparently 
contributng to the scheme run by the central character. If done well, this can acclimatize the mark to the sums of money involved and the 
steps that might be needed to get them. Expect the swindlers to be getting and waving around bank drafts. 

The modern equivalent of this might be a flood of compelling publicity suggesting that someone somewhere is hugely benefitting from the new and exciting scheme. Things move fast these days, so companies who want to be in on the act can't afford to be cautious, they have to make their move now. Where have we heard this kind of talk before?


## 7. Putting him on the send
 
In the old days, there was a delicate step where the mark had to go home and realize assets in order to contribute to the scheme. 
This is a visit to a hometown bank, where there is a deposit box containing valuable things that the mark
controls.
This is a risky moment for the con-men, because the mark will be back in contact within friends and family and might gain a realistic perspective on what is going on. 

In the old-fashioned setting, the commitment is financial, and the assets in question are dollars and cents sitting in a hometown bank. The modern version of this may involve a broader conception of what kind of asset is committed. For example, a modern company playing the role of a mark may have engineering and product developments that it has choices about how to direct.
The modern equivalent of the swindlers may wish to influence the direction of these resources, moving them in a direction that the mark might not otherwise choose. 
 
## 8. Taking off the touch
 
In the penultimate stage, the mark invests his own substantial assets in the scheme, which may appear to succeed, but is in fact a sham. The script calls for a final hitch that prevents the expected fabulous profits from coming to the mark. In the modern setting, the company playing the role of the mark commits resources in the hope of developing a product that works well with the semi-magical resources provided by it potential partners. Even if the effort succeeds, the first company may now be locked in to an unequal relationship with its partners, since their product would depend on wbat is provided by the partners.
 
## 9. Blowing him off

This is the final stage, the goal is to let the mark down gently.
If it works well, the mark doesn't even realize that there was a swindle, and thinks that everything that happened is just bad luck. The con artists benefit from this, because the mark has no reason to pursue them for retribution, but sees them as fellow victims.

### What we learned

Maurer's description of the long con includes elements that will be absent or not needed in the present day. The key features are that the mark is set up to participate, willingly and enthuiastically, in a scheme that turns out to be not at all in his interest, and that the swindlers benefit directly from the mark's decision to invest. We may be able to spot analogues of the stages given above, in which case it is reasonable to suppose that we are dealing with some kind of con.

From the perspective of the con artists, the challenge is to delicately lead the mark through a series of psychological states that predispose him to make the decisions that the script requires. The details differ, but the principles are eternal.

The con works, if it works, because it induces the mark to fall prey to a panoply of human weaknesses. These include:

 1. Optimism. If the mark didn't believe that the scheme had a chance of success, he would pull out before committing his own resources. 
 2. 


## Back to Chat GPT?

OK, what about Chat GPT? Placing myself as a potential mark, with an existing business, I find myself at stage 3 or 4. I am tempted to believe that Open AI is capable of somehow realizing fantastic profits, but it is mysterious how this is going to happen. Since I want AI to succeed, preferably in a way that is different from the advertising dependent successes of the past decade, I have begun to explore ways in which __my business__ could use this exciting new thing. Open AI hasn't asked me for anything yet. If I am gullible, I might think that Open AI has delivered the convincer, and we are actually at stage 5. I am starting to think that my business can't __not__ invest in a deeper collaboration with Open AI. If the whole thing is a scam, I am on the edge of a tight spot. 

Now, I'm not saying it is a scam, but if it were, that is where we would be. Open AI has no business idea or product that will make money by helping. There are some obvious, non-fantasy business cases for Chat GPT, such as the provision of plausible but meaning-free text on more or less any topic. Search engine optimizers will jump at the chance to fill their sites with text that is difficult to distinguish from genuinely valuable content. Lazy students will definitely find it easier to generate plausible responses for assignments that they don't want to do, or about material that they can't be bothered to learn. Chat GPT is not a patch on David Foster Wallace or Cormac McCarthy, but it can generate text that is agreeably weird. If these are the use cases that Open AI is after, I would say ``Have at it'', but that's not going to generate fabulous profits, and in any case any success would be pretty transient, especially in the first two applications, which are arms races between fakers and detectors of fakery. No cons involved there, I think.

Where there might be a con is if Chat GPT suckers the providers of educational materials, or legal search, or writing help into a dependence on their tools. Then we might be moving from stage 5 to stage 6, we might not be directly contributing money, but we would contributing subject expertise,  engagement and product design. Also, in this scenario, if the products, contrary to my personal expectations, actually work, stages 7, 8 and 9 are particularly horrible, since we finsh with a long-term dependency on Open AI, not a graceful let down and an acceptance of sunk resources. If the products __don't__ work, the simple version of stage 9 applies and we retreat, perhaps chastened, to our small towns.
