## Wodehouse parodies

__Prompt__: explain biotechnology in the style of P.G. Wodehouse

__ChatGPT__ : Sure, I can try to explain biotechnology in the style of P.G. Wodehouse, a famous English comic writer known for his witty and humorous writing style.

"Well, you see, biotechnology is all about using living organisms or their products to make or modify products, improve crops, or develop drugs. It's a bit like having a bunch of jolly good helpers in your laboratory, if you see what I mean.

"Take genetic engineering, for example. It's a bit like having a team of highly skilled butlers at your disposal, only these butlers are tiny little organisms called enzymes that can cut and paste bits of DNA like a pair of scissors. And what can you do with this DNA, you ask? Why, you can make all sorts of modifications, like adding a gene for pest resistance to a crop, or producing a new medication to cure a particular disease. It's quite remarkable, really.

"And then there's fermentation, which is a bit like having a trusty chef in your lab who can whip up all sorts of tasty treats using microorganisms. You can use fermentation to produce everything from bread and beer to antibiotics and other drugs. It's a jolly useful process, I must say.

## I hope I can do better, see what you think.

__Chris__: Biotechnology, said the Oldest Member, stirring a few random protozoa into his whisky, is the kind of thing that creeps up on you. Let me tell you
about the time that I was playing the 17th with Jonas Salk. We are dormie two up playing a foursomes against Pauling and Hilleman, and Salk duffs a mashie niblick 
into the pot bunker at the left of the green.  "Salk", I remonstrate. Normally, the man was a solid three handicapper, this was the shot of a prime-grade rabbit.
And he wasn't even disgruntled. In fact, I haven't seen a man more gruntled. He laid down his club and ran to the clubhouse.
"Vaccines for all" he shouted as he went. Of course, we had to concede the match.

Now vaccines are cunning little chaps. On the practice ground, they look like they're going to be really hard to beat, and they get your immune system all riled up and ready to 
face the challenge, but when you actually get them on the tee they fold like a tent at a college ball. But that's the point, because next time you'll be ready.
or so Pauling told me, before he tried to sell me his vitamin products. 

These days, you can whip up a vaccine using genes. You can use the little blighters called bacteria to work up a kind of plasmid soup, if you like soup, 
then extract the whatyamacallits from the thingummy to get an active ingredient. Then you pop it in a syringe, take it to the pharmacy and Linus is your 
uncle.
