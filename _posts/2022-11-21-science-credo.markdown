## Inspirations

- Richard Hamming wrote a book with a [spectacular vision of how to do great research](https://www.amazon.com/Art-Doing-Science-Engineering-Learning-ebook/dp/B088TMLQDC/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1ADYSC1PWXGM6&keywords=richard+hamming+the+art+of+doing+science+and+engineering&qid=1669044159&sprefix=richard+hamming%2Caps%2C124&sr=8-1). He asks people "what are you working on?" then "what is the most important problem in your field?" then "why aren't you working on that?" Hamming is famous for his work on error-correcting codes, and also for a lecture about "You and your research". The book is called "The Art of Doing Science and Engineering", but is worthwhile no matter what sort of scholarship you do.
- My thesis advisor, [Steve Isard](https://www.semanticscholar.org/author/S.-Isard/1901024?sort=influence) is interested in everything, knowledgeable about almost all of it, writes and publishes important stuff, and resists categorization as belonging to any particular field. I like that approach.
- Everybody quotes Feynman, “The first principle is not to fool yourself – and you are the easiest person to fool.”, but it bears repeating.
- Drew McDermott, in the 1970s, wrote [Artificial Intelligence Meets Natural Stupidity](https://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/irm/mcdermott.pdf) cataloguing ways in which AI researchers tended to fool themselves. The details are dated, but the lessons are eternal.
